You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create
an aplication to manage student enrollments and balance.

Your application should do the following:
1.Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
2.The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
3.The srudent should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
4.A student can enroll in the folowing courses: History 101, Mathematics 101, English 101, Chemistry 101, Computer Science 101
5.Each course costs $600 to enroll
7.The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
8.To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance
